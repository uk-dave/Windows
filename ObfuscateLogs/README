ObfuscateLogs
=============

This folder contains a Python application designed to process log 
files or directories of log files and obfuscate any personal or 
sensitive data based on predefined criteria. The program supports 
processing individual files or entire directories, and it allows 
for keyword-based obfuscation using a configuration file (`.ini` 
format).

This tool is particularly useful for sanitizing logs before sharing 
or analyzing them to ensure sensitive information is not exposed.
